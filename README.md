# 🤫 Queyla 🎁

A website used as part of a birthday surprise for two close friends.

I've been anonymously mailing them cut-up pieces of a jigsaw puzzle I made. When they assemble it, they'll see a riddle. The final piece will show the URL to this website where, if they enter the correct solution, they'll be taken to their birthday present.
